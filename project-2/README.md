# XML and JS Project 2
This is the second and final project for the XML and JavaScript class of the Information Technology course at Humber College. Things I've done:
- Generated a JSON via Mockaroo
- Developed an API (getAll(), getById())
- Developed a UI with filters
- Linked API and UI via Browserify
- Deployed the project on Netlify
