Our team decided to split up the work evenly with each person responsible for one equally challenging part of the project.

My part of the project was everything JavaScript-related. I am responsible for project1_data.js, including code that generates the HTML table from the XML, applies filters and resets the filters on Reset button click. I also implemented a feature that changes the state of filter controls based on the search params query so that filter controls don't reset when you click Submit.

I thoroughly tested the final product via http-server and I verified there are absolutely no bugs in the code. The project works as intended.
